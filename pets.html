        <p class="Inconsolata">
        My oldest pet is named Zafi. He will have been with my family for 8 years on December first.
        His fur looks black but in reality its a dark brown. He's an outdoor cat and he has his own daily
        schedule. He goes outside at around 6 am when my father leaves for work. He returns home at around 8 am
        after my mom returns from dropping of my siblings. Then he'll stay inside until my mom leaves to pick up
        my siblings around 3 pm. And then returns home for the day at 6 pm, when I am usually returning.

        <p class="Inconsolata">
        My second oldest pet is our dog Angel. He's a arrived about 5 months after we got our cat. They grew up
        together and lets just say my he follows my cat's lead. He's the calmest of all my pets, he's the one who
        will curl up next to you while you read. His favorite thing in the world is getting pets and cuddles.

        <h2 class='playball'>Luna, the Energetic</h2>
        <p class="Inconsolata">
          Luna is the youngest of my pets. We have had her for about 1 year and 2 months. We originally got her
          because my siblings and I have been to busy to spend time with Angel. So we got him a companian. Luna loves
          to play. She loves roaming our yard and just having fun. She's a licker so be careful when you hugger unless
          you'll welcome her kiss.
